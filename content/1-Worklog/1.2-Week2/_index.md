### Week 2 Achievements:

* Study the basic EC2 theory:: 
  * Instance types: different virtual hardware configurations provided by AWS to run EC2 instances, each optimized for specific use cases.
  * AMI: a template to launch EC2 instances, including the operating system, software, and volume configuration.
  * Ways to remote SSH into EC2: using an SSH Client with a key pair, EC2 Instance Connect via browser, Session Manager without opening port 22, and PuTTY on Windows with a .ppk file. 
  * Elastic IP: a static, public IPv4 address allocated to an AWS account and attachable/detachable to EC2 instances, ensuring a fixed public IP for stable external access.

* Successfully created and connected to EC2 via SSH.

* Study AWS Networking Services:
  * Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): a customizable virtual network in AWS Cloud that allows you to create an isolated and secure networking environment.
  * VPC Peering & Transit Gateway: VPC Peering directly connects two VPCs via private IPs (simple but no transitive routing), while Transit Gateway acts as a central hub to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks, supporting transitive routing, scalability, and centralized management.
  * VPN & Direct Connect: VPN connects on-premises networks to AWS over the Internet via encrypted tunnels (easy to deploy but Internet-dependent), while Direct Connect provides a dedicated connection with higher stability, bandwidth, and lower latency, though costlier and slower to set up.
  * Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): automatically distributes traffic across multiple resources to improve availability, scalability, and fault tolerance, with ALB (HTTP/HTTPS), NLB (high-performance TCP/UDP), and GWLB (virtual appliances).
