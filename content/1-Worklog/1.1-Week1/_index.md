### Week 1 Achievements:

* Understood what Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing is and grasp the basic foundation: 
  * Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
  * What Makes AWS Different is that it has been the leading cloud infrastructure provider for 15 consecutive years [as of the end of 2025], with a core focus on delivering real customer value in all of its leadership principles.
  * Starting Your Cloud Journey can be done by self-learning through AWS training courses. 
  * AWS Global Infrastructure includes Regions → Availability Zones (multiple independent data centers within a Region) → Edge Locations (content delivery closer to users) → Local Zones (resources near major cities) → Wavelength Zones (5G integration) → Outposts (AWS infrastructure deployed in customer data centers).

* Successfully created and configured an AWS Free Tier account.

* Became familiar with the AWS Management Console and learned how to find, access, and use services via the web interface.

* Installed and Using AWS Services::
  * Cost Management – AWS Budgets
  * Access Management – AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
